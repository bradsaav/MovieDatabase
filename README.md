# Movie Recommender

## Project Description
> * This **project** is a movie database/recommender. The user will input the movies that they have previously watched by searching through a database of movies, and record the rating of the movie. The user will also be able to select a movie in the database and view details such as the overall rating from other users or the acting cast. Based on the movies that the user has watched as well as their rating, the movie recommender will present a selection of movies that may be a good fit for the user.
>
> * This project is **interesting** to us because it seems like a practical application for movie watchers to decide on what they want to view next. 
>
> * We will **use** C++ to import a list of movies as well as other data such as ratings or acting cast. The user will be able to sort through this list based on desired parameters. The user will also enter information about the movies they have watched, which will be stored in their movies list. This list is used to calculate potential movies that would be recommended to the user. An algorithm will read the list and calculate an average value of features, weighing the movie less if the user rated the movie poorly. Based on this average, the algorithm will return movies which are closest to the user’s average.  If we decide on implementing a GUI, we can utilize a GUI library to program it.
>
> * The **inputs** of the project will be the movies and the ratings that the user inputs into their movie list. The outputs of the project should be a selection of movies that would be catered to the user as well as statistics about the user’s movie history.

> * This project will **primarily serve** as a searchable database of movies, a list of previously watched movies, and a recommendation tool.

## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
